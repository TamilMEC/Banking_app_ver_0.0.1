In this project, I have designed a consoled based bank app that simulates banking operations using JDBC, java and SQL. There are two users who can use this app, customers and admin. A customer can login to his account or can create a new account. After login, he can view his balance, deposit amount into his account, withdraw money to his account and also he can transfer money to other customer account and user can view his transaction details only when admin activate the account. An Admin also login into his account. An admin can view customer details by using customer account number and also he can accept  a customer account.

    1)Admin Login
      Admin can login to his account.Admin can able to view users account details using account number.
      Admin can accept the users account when user create new account.
      
    2)User Login
      User can create new account.After creating new account admin needs to activate the user account
      until the user can't able to login his account.
      once the admin activate the user account. User can able to view his account details,
      withdraw amount from his account,deposit amount to his account,transfer amount to another account,and also view his transaction details.
