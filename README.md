In this project, I have designed a consoled based bank app that simulates banking operations using JDBC, java and SQL. There are two users who can use this app, customers and admin. A customer can login to his account or can create a new account. After login, he can view his balance, deposit amount into his account, withdraw money from his account and also he can transfer money to other customer account only when admin activate the account. An Admin also login into his account. An admin can view customer details by using customer account number and also he can accept  a customer account.
